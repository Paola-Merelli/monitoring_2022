# let's recall the libraries we need
library(sdm)
library(raster) #predictor, the env variables i use to predict where the species can be found in the space
library(rgdal) #species, vector data: arrays of coordinates
# OSGeo project
# we are working with 2 dimensions
# we are going to deal with series of coordinates in space. species are an array of x and y points (see notes)

# species data. inside external, a folder inside sdm package, there are all the data
file <- system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm")
file
# shapefile is the correspondent funciton of raster, it cathces the points and put them in R
species <- shapefile(file) # exatcly as the raster function for raster files
species
# just one variable: occurrence. if u put species$Occurrence u have the occurrence for all the species. all the point are recorded with 0 and 1 
species$Occurrence
# i want to make a subset. let's use sql, language for subsetting the data. let's make a subset of the species which are presents, so the 1.
# how many occurrences are there?
# u can count all the 1 but we are lazy
# i will put my dataset and inside i make the query, wich is done by []
presences <- species[species$Occurrence == 1,] # i want to subsetonly the occurrences equal to 1. in this case the symble is double equal, ==. if u want to take the occurrences different from 1 only single equal and !, !=.
# control symble, used to explain to the software theÃ¬at the query is finished. in R is a comma
# u obtain the datafram with 94 points which are the points equal to 1
# let's hsk for the occurrences equal to zero
absences <- species[species$Occurrence == 0,] #or != 1
# now we can plot all the datas
plot(species, pch=19) #we have all the points
# let's plot only presences
plot(presences, pch=19, col="blue") # less points
#let's add to this plot also the absences. so make a single plot with presences and absences, differentiated by color
# to add points to a plot use points()
points(absences, pch=19, col="red")

# predictors (tag till the end)
# look at the path
path <- system.file("external", package="sdm")
path #u obtain the folder of the predictors data, that all have the same extention, asc sort of txt. the type of file is ASCII
# the environmental variables are in the same folder of the species but with the extenction asc
# let's make a list with all the variables
lst <- list.files(path, pattern="asc", full.names=T)
# tag why full names
# let's make the stack of this list
# u can use the lapply function with the raster function but in this case is not needed since the data are inside the package and have asc extention
preds <- stack(lst)
